Draw a circle!
==============

Despite undeniable progress in drawing other things, most graphics editing software still relies on an archaic way to draw a circle: by clicking and dragging you define the two opposite corners of the circle's <em>bounding box</em> instead of the circle itself. This comes all the way from the first Mac Paint, over 30 years ago.

How about doing it a bit differently: why not make the first mouse click one point on the circle and the mouse position while dragging another (circles can be defined through two points). This makes for a much more intuitive way to create circles.

Here's a quick demo that lets you try the two approaches side-by-side. Also works on the iPad (landscape mode).
